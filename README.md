# altered
OpenACS ERP inspired by italian Alter by Oasi Software

Altered is developed and used in the context of the small family business and grows in feature only on demand. Its goal is to stay as simple as possible and to run in very constrained environments such as low-powered SBCs.

It is currently localized in english and italian.
